### What is a uniqueness?

Uniqueness is the unique characteristic of a Pathway, and is the most important ingredient for promoting to Sequence 0. Uniqueness is also referred to as the symbolism or authority of the corresponding Pathway.

Uniquenesses are typically abstract items or concepts. They can Come to Life and exist on their own, exist in the form of an Item or Sealed Artifact with limited or no consciousness, or be Accommodated inside a Beyonder.

### How to get one?

There is no and will not be any info about it in the future.

The uniqueness is simply given to one of the players from the pathway if they have unlocked this feature. Other players cannot get it from this player by killing him, taking him hostage, making him agree to transfer it or by any other means.

We can even say that the Uniqueness chooses the player, not the other way around. There have been some rumors that building your own churches, hosting events, staying socially active for a long time, being friendly and positive towards one's own pathway can contribute to getting it. However, in the end no one knows how one gets it.

### How to accommodate it?

The key to uniqueness's accommodation is time. You cannot forcibly make it yours, you have to wait until it recognizes you as its owner. Using spells, just playing and spending spirituality can help with it.

Upon dying, the accommodation will always **decrease by 10%**, no matter what was the cause of the death - another player or environment; but it will never go lower than 10%.

### What does it give?

First, it is a required component for ascending to Sequence 0. You will need a potion **AND** fully accommodated Uniqueness to advance further.

Second, it upon accommodating it gives valuable bonuses for its holder:
- Spiritual Dominance 
> Increases spirituality regeneration rate based on accommodation level
- Divine Resilience
> Increases maximum spirituality based on accommodation level
- Acting Acceleration
> Increases acting point gains based on accommodation level
- Authority Amplification
> Increases ability power and damage based on accommodation level

These will be opened at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% accommodation percentages. In the future there will also be pathway-specific traits, but for now they are only in development.
