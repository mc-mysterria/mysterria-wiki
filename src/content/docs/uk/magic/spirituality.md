### What is Spirituality?

As soon as you become a Beyonder, you gain the ability to use the abilities of your Pathway. However, unlimited use of magic would be too simple an advantage, so you are limited by Spirituality.

Spirituality functions as a measure of your character's inner fortitude. Employing any ability depletes a portion of your Spirituality, requiring judicious use. Fortunately, Spirituality regenerates on its own, so there's no need for alarm if it depletes.

:::danger[Warning]
If you spend more than 90% of your Spirituality while not in Safe Mode, you may lose control over your power, which will lead to mutation and loss of all abilities!

### Does it increase later?

Yes, yes, it does.

The maximum limit of your spirituality gets higher based on your current acting as well as Sequence. Just after advancing you will always get just **50%** of your current limit, but after using your spells for a little bit and getting 100% acting - it will increase by another 50%, so on and so forth. 

It also gets bigger based on your Sequence. For example, Sequence 9 only has 100 by default, but if you manage to advance to Sequence 0 - your limit will be of 500,000!

### How fast does it regenerate?

Well, it depends.

Mostly depends on your maximum limit, Sequence and conditional passive abilities you may have. For example, Fool's **Spiritualism** will drastically enhance your spirituality restoration ration, constantly regenerating from 2 to 5 percent of your limit!
