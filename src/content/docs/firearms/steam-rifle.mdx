### Reload Mechanics

The Steam-Pressured Rifle features **Kar98k-style reload mechanics** with sequential loading.

### How Kar98k-Style Reload Works

- **One at a time:** Each round loads individually
- **Interruptible:** You can **stop reloading and fire** at any moment
- **Flexible:** Load 1-5 rounds depending on tactical needs
- **Authentic:** Inspired by real Kar98k bolt-action rifles

### Reload Timing

**Full Reload:** 4 seconds for 5 rounds (~0.8 seconds per round)

| Rounds to Load | Approximate Time |
|----------------|------------------|
| 1 round | ~0.8 seconds |
| 2 rounds | ~1.6 seconds |
| 3 rounds | ~2.4 seconds |
| 4 rounds | ~3.2 seconds |
| 5 rounds (full) | ~4.0 seconds |

<Aside type="tip">
**Sniper Reload Strategy:** After firing a killing shot, immediately start reloading. If another target appears, you can fire your partially-loaded rounds!
</Aside>

- 6 cases require 2 brass
- 6 cores require 1 iron ingot + 1 brass
- **Total: 3 brass + 1 iron ingot for 6 rounds**
