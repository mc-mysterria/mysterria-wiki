**Step 1:** Craft Deathknell Cartridge Cases
- Recipe: `1 Brass + 1 Iron Nugget → 6 Cases`

**Step 2:** Craft Deathknell Cartridge Cores
- Recipe: `6 Iron Nuggets → 6 Cores`

**Step 3:** Assemble Standard Deathknell Rounds
- Recipe: `1 Case + 1 Core + 1 Gunpowder → 1 Deathknell Round`

<Aside>
Deathknell ammunition requires more iron nuggets than Klein ammunition, making it slightly more expensive to produce.

### Reload Mechanics

The Deathknell Revolver features **authentic sequential reload mechanics**, similar to real-world revolvers.

### How Sequential Reload Works

- **One at a time:** Each round loads individually (0.8 seconds per round)
- **Interruptible:** You can **stop reloading and fire** at any moment
- **Flexible:** Load 1-6 rounds depending on what you need
- **Tactical:** Adapt reload timing to combat situations

### Reload Timing Examples

| Rounds to Load | Time Required |
|----------------|---------------|
| 1 round | 0.8 seconds |
| 2 rounds | 1.6 seconds |
| 3 rounds | 2.4 seconds |
| 4 rounds | 3.2 seconds |
| 5 rounds | 4.0 seconds |
| 6 rounds (full) | 4.8 seconds |

<Aside type="tip">
**Tactical Advantage:** If an enemy appears while reloading, you can fire your partially-loaded rounds immediately instead of being defenseless like with Klein's Repeater!
</Aside>

### Combat Guide

### Best Use Cases

**Medium to Long Range Combat (20-60 blocks):**
- High damage per shot with excellent range
- Tactical reload allows combat flexibility
- Effective against armored opponents

**PvP Scenarios:**
- Two-shot kill potential on unarmored players
- Spirit Control rounds for disabling
- Deprivation rounds to remove enemy buffs

### Tactical Tips

<Aside type="tip">
**Master the Partial Reload:** Don't always reload to full! Load 2-3 rounds quickly if enemies are nearby.
</Aside>

**Pre-Combat:**
- Load Implosive or Exorcist rounds for opening shots
- Position at 30-50 blocks for optimal engagement
- Ensure full magazine before initiating

**During Combat:**
- **Stand still** when firing for perfect accuracy
- Use sequential reload tactically - load minimum needed
- Fire partial magazine if threatened during reload
- Reload behind cover between engagements

**Ammunition Selection:**
- **Boss Fights:** Implosive Rounds (10.0 damage)
- **Undead Mobs:** Exorcist Rounds (20.0 damage vs undead!)

### Advanced Tactics

### The Reload Feint

1. Start reloading to bait enemy aggression
2. Load 1-2 rounds (1.6 seconds)
3. Fire when enemy commits
4. Continue reload after repelling attack

### Ammunition Swapping Mid-Combat

1. Keep multiple ammo types in hotbar
2. Empty current magazine
3. Reload with different ammo type
4. Adapt to changing combat situations

### Positioning Strategy

**Optimal Range:** 30-50 blocks
- Close enough for accuracy
- Far enough to reload safely
- Within Deathknell's effective range

**Movement:**
- Strafe while reloading
- Stand still only when firing
- Use cover between shots

**Why Choose Deathknell:**
- You need more damage than Klein's Repeater
- You want tactical reload flexibility
- You engage at medium range frequently
- You've completed enough dungeons to get parts

**When to Use Rifle Instead:**
- You need maximum damage (14.0 vs 8.0)
- You engage at very long range (100 blocks)
- You don't mind the 4-second reload
