### Who are beyonder creatures?

Sometimes Beyonder Creatures appear in the world - they are special creatures endowed with magical power. They have a similar appearance to ordinary mobs but have a number of important differences:

**Differences from Ordinary Mobs:**
- Colored signature that indicates the creature's name
- Significantly more health, the health is visible in the actionbar
- Their attacks are stronger than ordinary mobs, they direct damage to your soul
- When killed, they always give experience, as well as acting points
- After death, they can drop beyonder ingredients

### Where do they spawn?

That's a great question, since it is not that obvious!

Every type of Beyonder Creature has a list of **biomes** it can spawn in. If you have stayed in a certain zone for two weeks and haven't met a single Beyonder Creature so far - it means that this area is not taken by any type; while on the other hand the location to the North with different biome can have several Beyonder Creatures at once!

We will not disclose the list of their biomes, if you are interested, you will have to do it on your own. Maybe in the future some abilities will be able to decypher and confirm your wild guesses!

### Why are they dangerous?

:::tip[Tip]
Always have potions, armor and an escape plan with you — an encounter with a Beyonder Creature can be fatal, especially if you are not a low-sequence Beyonder yourself!
:::

Beyonder Creatures have custom AI, different from ordinary monsters. They can attack, group, flee when low on health, use special abilities and even call for help!

Their AI will be enhanced later on, so stay tuned for updates!
