### What is a mutation?

If you exceed the limit of Spirituality usage, this can lead to unpredictable consequences:
- You will lose all your abilities
- You will turn into a monster

Mutation will strip away any Beyonder power you had before, effectively making you a mundane person again. Your stripped power will get a new body, which will be extremely aggressive towards anyone in the vicinity.

### What are the consequences?

If this has already begun, you still have a chance to stop and revert the process. But if the mutation is irreversible, prepare for the worst:
- You will lose everything you had so far (items, pathway & sequence)
- You will turn into a powerful mutant that will hunt you and anyone in the vicinity
- If your mutant is killed, it will drop a Beyonder Characteristic of your Sequence
- You will get a cooldown of **three real days** of becoming a Beyonder again

### What can cause a mutation?

There are several ways:

- Overusing your spirituality without **Safe Mode** on
- Being driven crazy by your own abilities (Hanged Man pathway)
- Being driven crazy by other abilities (Visionary pathway)

### What is a safe mode?

If you are not confident in your abilities, you can activate **Safe Mode**

It allows you to:
- Use all abilities without the risk of losing control
- Not worry about Spirituality, as it will never be less than 10%

Instead, you receive less digestion for using abilities, as well as reduced total Spirituality volume (80% of maximum). Safe mode is activated automatically for everyone by default.
