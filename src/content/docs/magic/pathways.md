### What is a magic pathway?

The path to becoming a Beyonder begins with choosing the first Sequence 9 potion. You can choose from 22 currently available pathways: Abyss, Black Emperor, Chained, Darkness, Death, Demoness, Door, Error, Fool, Fortune, Hanged Man, Hermit, Justiciar, Moon, Mother, Paragon, Priest, Sun, Tyrant, Visionary, Twilight Giant, Red Priest, White Tower. 

Each pathway has unique abilities and special conditions for advancement.

### Sequence progression

1. **Low Sequences:** 9 → 8 level
2. **Middle Sequences:** 7 → 5 level
3. **High Sequences:**
    - 4 - Demigod
    - 3 - Saint
    - 2 - Angel
    - 1 - King of Angels

### Is there a way to change pathways?

Yes, but it will be a painful and dangerous process:
- It's safe only among adjacent pathways (e.g. fool <-> error)
- It's possible only after a certain sequence (after Sequence 7)
- Some spells can also help you switch your pathway

You can learn more on the official wiki of the web novel. If you don't want to go through this, choose your pathway wisely!

### How do different pathways differ?

Each pathway has its strengths and weaknesses:
- **Sun** - light, purification, support
- **Door** - teleportation, mobility, spatial tricks
- **Tyrant** - lightning, water spells, strength and pressure in battle
- **Fool** - deception, illusions, unpredictable moves
- **Priest** - crowd influence, glass cannon, fire magic
- **Demoness** - temptation, curses, mirror magic
- **Error** - rule breaking, theft, deception
- **Visionary** - foresight, protection, intimidation
- **Hanged Man** - souls, blood, corruption
- **Wheel of Fortune** - luck, crits, random bonuses
- **Darkness** - dreams, nightmares, control
- ...etc

### Can I immediately advance to a high level?

No. All players start from Sequence 9 and gradually advance further, fulfilling conditions and gathering the necessary resources.
