### What is acting?

Imagine the core powers of your potion as a tightly guarded castle. The remnants of the psyche that can cause a backlash resides within that castle. Our goal is to get rid of it and become the true master of the castle.

There are two ways we can do that. The first is to forcefully invade the castle. There is no guarantee that this will work, and you will most definitely injure yourself unless you can suppress it with absolute power. But of course, we are not equipped to do that.

The second way is to get the owner of the castle to extend an invitation. This invitation can allow us to slide through the scrutiny of the guards and infiltrate the castle. We can then easily finish off the enemies. But the problem lies in the fact that this invitation specifies the facial features and characteristics of the guest. Thus, we have to disguise ourselves and act as a guest

### Why do you need it?

Loss of control is possible not only through Spirituality! If you drink a potion that doesn't suit you, or if you cannot fully digest it, you risk losing control.

To drink a potion of the next Sequence (for example, from Sequence 8 to Sequence 7), you **must** fully digest the current potion.

Digestion happens **through using abilities**. The more you use the powers of your level, the faster digestion grows.

**Additionally:**
- The higher the ability level, the more digestion you receive
- If you just play, digestion also accumulates passively
- You also receive additional digestion by killing Beyonder Creatures

:::tip[Useful fact]
The digestion level affects your spirituality reserve! The more digestion – the greater your spirituality supply.

### How to act better?

At first, the mechanics may seem too complex and turn into a grind. But that's not entirely true! Here are some tips that will help you advance more effectively:

**Don't rush** - Consider the digestion process as part of the game, not as an intrusive limitation. Who knows what secrets are hidden in your abilities?

**Use abilities regularly** - The more you use your powers, the faster you can advance. This is especially important for abilities of your current level – they give more digestion!

**Don't take risks** - If you have little Spirituality, don't use abilities mindlessly. Lost control can have fatal consequences!

**Don't forget about passive digestion** - Even if you don't use abilities, you still receive additional digestion!
