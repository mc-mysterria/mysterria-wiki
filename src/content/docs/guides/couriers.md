### What are Couriers?

Couriers are supernatural messengers — Skeletons, Jellyfish, and Incinerated spirits — that carry items directly to other players. Summon one with a **Horn of Summoning**, hand it your delivery, and it handles the rest.

---

### Getting a Horn of Summoning

**Courier Horn Shards** drop from loot chests found across the Overworld. Collect **3 shards** and craft them into a Horn of Summoning using an **L-shape** in a crafting table:

```
[Shard] [     ]
[Shard] [     ]
[Shard] [Shard]
```

### Courier Types

The courier summoned by your horn is determined by your **highest available permission**. If you hold more than one, the most powerful courier is always chosen.

| Courier | Capacity | Delivery Time |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| 🦴 **Skeleton** | 1 item | 5 min |
| 🪼 **Jellyfish** | 2 items | 5 min |
| 🔥 **Incinerated** | 2 items | 3 min |

> **Note:** Couriers cannot carry stacked items. Each item slot must contain a single item.

### How to Send Items

1. **Right-click** with the Horn of Summoning. Your courier will appear beside you.
2. **Left-click** the courier to open its interface.
3. Place up to the allowed number of **items** into the courier's slots.
4. Click **Select Recipient** and choose the player you want to send to.
5. Click **Confirm Delivery** to dispatch the courier.

The sender and recipient will both receive a chat notification when the delivery starts and when it arrives.

---

### Offline Delivery

If your recipient is **offline** when you send, the items are queued. The courier will deliver automatically the next time they log in, once the original delivery timer has elapsed.

---

### Where Couriers Work

Couriers can be summoned and will deliver in the following dimensions:

- Overworld
- Nether
- Manipulation Pool
- Mirror Realm
- Nightmare Pool
- Secret Lair

Attempting to summon a courier in any other dimension (such as The End) will fail.

### Tips

1. **Pick up your courier** — left-clicking it opens the GUI. Don't walk away before loading your items, or the courier will despawn.
2. **One item at a time** — stacked items are rejected. Split your stacks before placing them in the courier.
3. **Stay accessible** — if the recipient is above Y 320 or in an unsupported dimension at delivery time, the courier will retry every 5 seconds automatically.
