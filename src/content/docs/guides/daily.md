### What are daily rewards?

For playing regularly every day, you will receive more and more rewards in the form of Brilliant Emporium points. The menu is accessible using the `/daily` command, but don't worry, the game will remind you about your unclaimed rewards!

### Types of Rewards

There are several types of rewards:
- For daily server login, you also get a streak in a row
- For playing 1 hour, while not being AFK
- For playing 3 hours, while not being AFK

### Additional Rewards

You can also receive additional points for helping the server, voting on monitoring sites, reporting bugs, or for your activity!

- Players who report critical bugs receive additional points for their confirmation and fixing (just ask)
- Moderators and Administrators receive many points as a reward for their work, as well as a special boon
- The same applies to Designers, Authors, Promoters, and others! If you think you can be useful, just ask!
