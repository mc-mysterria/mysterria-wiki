### What are Town Perks?

Town Perks is a prestigious system designed to reward players who create exceptional architectural works and impressive structures. By constructing significant builds, players may be granted special buffs and bonuses that apply to designated territories within or near their cities. These enhancements can improve various aspects of gameplay, including agriculture, combat effectiveness, crafting, and unique abilities.

### How to Request a Town Perk

To be considered for a Town Perk, please follow these steps:

1. Construct a substantial and impressive building or structure in or near your city
2. Ensure your build has a clear, cohesive theme that complements your city's overall aesthetic
3. Submit a support ticket requesting consideration for a Town Perk
4. Server administration will evaluate your build based on:
   - Thematic consistency and creative vision
   - Scale, detail, and construction quality
   - Integration with the surrounding city environment

The type of buff granted, along with its parameters and effectiveness, will be determined by the administration team to appropriately reflect your build's purpose, theme, and overall quality.

### Available Buff Types

The following buff types may be granted based on the nature and theme of your construction:

#### Mob Protection
Prevents hostile mobs from spawning within the designated territory. This buff is particularly well-suited for peaceful gardens, temples, meditation areas, or residential safe zones where tranquility is paramount.

#### Potion Effects
Provides continuous beneficial potion effects to all players present within the territory. Effects may include enhanced speed, increased strength, regeneration, or any other appropriate potion effect. This buff is ideal for training grounds, mystical shrines, or enchanted locations.

#### Enhanced Agriculture
Significantly accelerates the growth rate of all crops planted within the territory. This buff is most appropriate for farms, agricultural districts, botanical gardens, or druidic groves dedicated to cultivation.

#### Armor Restoration
Gradually repairs the durability of equipped armor while players remain within the territory. This buff is particularly fitting for blacksmith districts, armories, fortifications, or sacred sites under divine protection.

#### Experience Boost
Multiplies all experience points gained from any source while within the territory. This enhancement is perfect for libraries, academies, training facilities, or monuments to knowledge and learning.

#### Acting Enhancement
Increases the acting speed for Beyonders present in the territory. This specialized buff is most suitable for mystical locations, meditation chambers, spiritual sites, or places of supernatural significance.

#### Spiritual Regeneration
Continuously grants acting points to Beyonders over time while they remain within the territory. This buff is best applied to temples, shrines, holy grounds, or other locations of profound spiritual importance.

### Territory Coverage

When a buff is granted to your build, the administration will define the area of effect using one of the following territory configurations:

#### Circular Area
A circular region centered around a specific point, extending outward to a defined radius. This configuration is straightforward and effective for single buildings, monuments, or centralized structures.

#### Rectangular Area
A rectangular region defined by two opposite corner points, creating a box-shaped territory. This method is well-suited for city districts, building complexes, or structured developments with defined boundaries.

#### Custom Polygon
A flexible territory shape defined by multiple points, allowing for irregular or organic boundaries. This configuration is ideal for areas with natural contours, non-uniform city layouts, or builds that follow terrain features.

#### Town Claim
The buff applies to your town's entire existing town claim boundaries. This approach is convenient for town-wide benefits and eliminates the need for manual territory selection.

### Guidelines for Consideration

When planning your build and submitting a request, please keep the following in mind:

- **Scale and Detail**: Larger constructions with greater attention to detail are more likely to receive more powerful buff configurations
- **Thematic Appropriateness**: The buff type should align with your build's purpose. For example, an agricultural complex would naturally receive Enhanced Agriculture rather than Mob Protection
- **Clear Purpose**: Structures with well-defined functions and roles are easier for administrators to evaluate and match with suitable buffs
- **Multiple Perks**: Players may receive multiple buffs across different builds, allowing cities to accumulate various benefits over time
- **Completion Required**: Please ensure your construction is fully completed before submitting a request for evaluation

The Town Perks system is designed to recognize and reward dedication to exceptional city-building, encouraging creativity and fostering vibrant, meaningful player communities through tangible gameplay benefits.
