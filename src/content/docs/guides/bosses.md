### Who is a Guardian?

A Guardian (or "Boss") is a powerful enemy that can be encountered in the open world. Each of them spawns with a **6-hour** interval at a random location, which will be announced in chat. You will receive corresponding notifications in chat 30, 15, 5, and 1 minute before their appearances.
