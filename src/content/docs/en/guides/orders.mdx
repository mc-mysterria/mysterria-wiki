## Secret Organizations

Secret organizations are a new mechanic on our server. It allows several players to create their own **Order**, spreading its influence on the world.

Secret organizations are functionality available only through donations, which is active while the leader's subscription is active and provides ascending benefits with the organization's development that increase interaction convenience and player progress.
