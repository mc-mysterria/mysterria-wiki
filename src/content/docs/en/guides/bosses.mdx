## What is a Guardian?

A Guardian (or "Boss") is a powerful enemy that can be encountered in the open world. Each of them spawns with a **6-hour** interval at a random location, which will be announced in chat. You will receive corresponding notifications in chat 30, 15, 5, and 1 minute before their appearance.

import example from "../../../../assets/bosses/example.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={example.src}
        width="95%"
        alt="Boss Example"
    />
</p>

## Victory Rewards

If you defeat this powerful Guardian before it disappears on its own, you will receive a special **"Reward Token"** item that looks like this:

import roulette from "../../../../assets/bosses/roulette.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={roulette.src}
        width="95%"
        alt="Roulette Example"
    />
</p>

Right-click, spin the wheel, and win very valuable rewards that are unique to this Guardian!

import dice from "../../../../assets/bosses/dice.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={dice.src}
        width="95%"
        alt="Dice"
    />
</p>

## Important Things to Note

- Battle difficulty increases with the number of players participating
- Rewards can be given to other players or opened later
- You can use the "Boss Compass" to search for bosses

import compass from "../../../../assets/bosses/compass.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={compass.src}
        width="95%"
        alt="Compass"
    />
</p>

- Bosses have different schedules on weekends than on weekdays
