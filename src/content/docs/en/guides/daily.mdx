## Daily Rewards

For systematic daily play, you will receive progressively more rewards in the form of Brilliant Emporium points.

import daily from "../../../../assets/daily/menu.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={daily.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Daily Menu"
    />
</p>

The menu is available with the `/daily` command, but don't worry, the game will remind you about unclaimed rewards!

## Types of Rewards

There are several types of rewards:
- For daily server login

import login from "../../../../assets/daily/login.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={login.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Login Reward"
    />
</p>

- For playing 1 hour

import hour from "../../../../assets/daily/hour.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={hour.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Hour Reward"
    />
</p>

- For playing 3 hours

import three from "../../../../assets/daily/three.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={three.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Three Hour Reward"
    />
</p>

- Players who report critical bugs receive additional points for their confirmation and fixing
- Moderators and Administrators receive many points as a reward for their work
