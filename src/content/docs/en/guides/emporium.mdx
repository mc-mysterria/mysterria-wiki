## Brilliant Emporium

A new mechanic is available for every player on the server - the **Brilliant Emporium**. This is a special shop where you can buy unique items that are not available in regular stores, mainly made for magical potions.

The Emporium is available with the `/emporium` or `/emp` command. The menu looks like this:

import emporium from "../../../../assets/emporium/main-menu.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={emporium.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Emporium Menu"
    />
</p>

## Emporium Categories

The Emporium is divided into 5 categories:

- Ingredients
- Mystery Boxes
- Enchantments
- Magic Recipes
- Potions

Each category contains a number of items that change from the general set each day. The final price also changes each day, but the base price is the same for all items in one category.

import ingredients from "../../../../assets/emporium/ingredients.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={ingredients.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Ingredients Menu"
    />
</p>

import example from "../../../../assets/emporium/item-example.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={example.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Ingredient Example"
    />
</p>

The sale limit for each product is limited, first come, first served!

## Mystery Boxes

If you want to try your luck, you can purchase a mystery box in the corresponding category. Open it by holding it in your hand and right-clicking. The general set of rewards depends on the box level, but the rewards themselves can be anything!

import boxes from "../../../../assets/emporium/boxes.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={boxes.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Boxes"
    />
</p>
