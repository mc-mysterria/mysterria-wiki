## What are Energy Shards?

Energy Shards are a new currency that looks like this:

import shards from "../../../../assets/shards/shard.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={shards.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Shard Item"
    />
</p>

## What are they needed for?

This new currency is needed for many things, such as:
- Upgrading levels of Secret Organizations
- Weakening entrances to Dungeons (Nodes)
- Paying for Silk Road caravan services

## How to obtain them?

For this, we need homeless villagers (nitwits), who previously had no purpose.

import nitwit from "../../../../assets/shards/nitwit.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={nitwit.src}
        width="80%"
        alt="Nitwit Menu"
    />
</p>

Each of them can buy any magical ingredient from you in exchange for an Energy Shard.
