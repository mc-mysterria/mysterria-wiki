## What is a Dungeon?

A Dungeon (or "Adventure") is a separate dimension with its own rules, inhabitants, and challenges. A team of several players enters it, receives provided equipment, and must advance forward, gradually defeating enemies in rooms. At the end, a powerful Boss awaits your party, and defeating it grants you the right to emerge victorious from this dimension and take all the earned rewards.

## What are Nodes?

To enter the Dungeon itself, you need to find an entrance to it, which is located somewhere in the open world. It looks like a pillar of multicolored particles that gather in an interesting pattern, change color, shimmer, and rise above the center. It may look like this:

import node from "../../../../assets/nodes/node.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={node.src}
        width="95%"
        alt="Node"
    />
</p>

Each Node may also have a sign attached to it:

import diplay from "../../../../assets/nodes/display.png";

<p align="center">
    <img
        src={diplay.src}
        width="60%"
        alt="Display"
    />
</p>

## How to Activate a Node?

To activate a Node and open a passage through it to the corresponding **Adventure**, you need to weaken it:

1. Find its location in the world
2. Get close to it, wait for it to knock you back
3. Wait for the message:

> The Node is too strong. You can try to weaken it. [Try?]

4. Click on **[Try?]**
5. Withstand the power of the defensive mechanism

**Energy Fragments** are used for weakening. The weakening progress is shown on the sign attached to it and located near the entrance itself (it's not visible through blocks).

Good luck!
