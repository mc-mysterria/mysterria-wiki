## What is Mystical Weaponry?

Mystical Weaponry brings the legendary firearms from Lord of the Mysteries into Minecraft! Craft powerful weapons, load them with specialized ammunition, and experience a whole new dimension of combat.

## What You'll Need

To get started with mystical firearms:

1. **A Weaponsmith Table** - Special crafting station for assembling weapons
2. **Weapon Parts** - Components to build your weapon
3. **Ammunition** - Bullets to fire your weapon

## How to Use Weapons

### Basic Controls

- **Right-Click:** Fire
- **Left-Click:** Reload

### Firing Your Weapon

1. Hold the weapon in your hand
2. Ensure you have ammunition loaded
3. Aim at your target
4. Right-click to fire
5. Watch the action bar for your current ammo count

### Understanding the HUD

The action bar (above your hotbar) shows:
- **Current Ammo / Max Ammo** (e.g., "Klein's Repeater 4/6")
- **Reload Status** (yellow "Reloading..." during reload)
- **Ammo Type** (colored text showing your current ammunition effect)
- **Special Warnings** (red "No ammo!" when empty)

## Weapon Comparison

| Weapon | Type | Damage | Magazine | Range | Reload Time | Fire Rate | Availability |
|--------|------|--------|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Klein's Repeater** | Repeater | 4.0 | 6 rounds | 40 blocks | 3s (full) | 1/second | Craftable |
| **Deathknell Revolver** | Revolver | 8.0 | 6 rounds | 60 blocks | 0.8s (each) | 0.9s/shot | Dungeon Reward |
| **Steam-Pressured Rifle** | Rifle | 14.0 | 5 rounds | 100 blocks | 4s (full) | 1.5s/shot | Dungeon Reward |

<Aside type="tip">
**Klein's Repeater** is the only weapon you can craft from scratch. **Deathknell Revolver** and **Steam-Pressured Rifle** require parts obtained as rewards from dungeons (nodes).

## Combat Mechanics

### Accuracy System

Your accuracy varies based on your movement:

- **Standing Still:** Perfect accuracy (0° spread)
- **Moving:** 4° bullet spread
- **In Air (jumping/falling):** 8° bullet spread

<Aside type="tip">**Accuracy Matters:** Stand still for best precision when taking important shots!</Aside>

### Reload Mechanics

Different weapons have different reload systems:

**Full Magazine Reload (Klein's Repeater):**
- Loads all rounds at once
- 3-second reload time
- Cannot interrupt - must complete full reload

**Sequential Reload (Deathknell Revolver & Steam-Pressured Rifle):**
- Loads one round at a time
- Can interrupt reload to fire
- Tactical advantage - partial reload possible
