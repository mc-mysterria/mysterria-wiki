:::caution[⚠️ Disclaimer]
> 🎭 What fate gives, one must always pay for, isn't that so?

The magic mechanics on the server are quite **complex** and require **knowledge and skills** from the player.  
There is always a risk of **losing items, abilities, or even life**.  
**Be careful!** If you are not confident in your abilities, **it's better not to risk**.  
The responsibility for your actions lies **entirely on you**.

## 🔮 Spirituality

As soon as you become a **Beyonder**, you gain the ability to use the abilities of your **Pathway**.  
However, **unlimited use** of magic would be too simple an advantage, so you are limited by **Spirituality**.

💠 **What is Spirituality?**  
It's a scale that shows the **reserve of strength** of your character.  
Each ability consumes a **certain amount** of Spirituality, so it's important to use it **rationally**.  
⚡ **Spirituality recovers automatically**, so don't panic about losing it.

:::danger[🚨 Warning]  
If you spend **more than 90%** of your Spirituality,  
you **may lose control over your power**, which will lead to **mutation** and loss of all abilities!  
:::

## 💀 Loss of Control

If you **exceed the limit of Spirituality usage**, this can lead to **unpredictable consequences**:
- You may **lose all your abilities**.
- You **may turn into a monster**.

If this has already begun, you **have a chance to stop the process**.  
But if the mutation is irreversible, prepare for the worst:
- You will **lose everything** you had.
- You will **turn into a mutant** that will **hunt you**.
- **If your mutant is killed**, you will receive an **Unlimited Characteristic** of the level you had before losing control.

## 🧪 Digestion

🌀 **Loss of control is possible not only through Spirituality!**

If you drink **a potion that doesn't suit you**,  
or if you cannot **fully digest it**, you **risk losing control**.

### 🏆 How to digest potions?

To drink a potion of the **next Sequence** (for example, from 8th to 7th),  
you must **fully digest** the current potion.

🔹 Digestion happens through **using abilities**.  
🔹 The more you use the powers of your level, the faster **digestion grows**.

**Additionally:**
- The **higher the ability level**, the more digestion you receive.
- If you **just play**, digestion also **accumulates passively**.
- For killing **Beyonder Creatures** you also receive **additional digestion**.

:::tip[💡 Useful fact]  
The digestion level affects **your spirituality reserve**!  
The more digestion – the **greater your spirituality supply**.

## 👐 Safe Mode

🌀 If you are **not confident** in your abilities, you can activate **Safe Mode**

It allows you to:
- Use abilities without risk of losing control.
- Not worry about Spirituality, as it will never be less than 10%.

Instead, you receive **less digestion** for using abilities, as well as reduced total Spirituality volume (80% of maximum). Safe mode is activated automatically for everyone by default.

## 🛠️ Useful Tips

🌀 At first, the mechanics may seem **too complex** and turn into a **grind**.  
But that's not entirely true! Here are some tips that will help you **advance more effectively**:

✅ **Don't rush**  
Consider the digestion process **as part of the game**, not as an intrusive limitation.  
Who knows **what secrets are hidden** in your abilities?

✅ **Use abilities regularly**  
The more you **use your powers**, the faster you can **advance**.  
This is especially important for **abilities of your current level** – they give more digestion!

✅ **Don't take risks**  
If you have **little Spirituality**, don't use abilities mindlessly.  
Lost control can have **fatal consequences**!

✅ **Don't forget about passive digestion**  
Even if you **don't use abilities**, you still receive **additional digestion**!
